# OntroBot
My personal discord bot  
If you want to use it create file called ".env" in the same directory as package.json with these variables:
```
DJS_TOKEN=(bot token)
YT_TOKEN=(youtube token)
STATUS=(status under name)
SPOTIFY_OAUTH=(spotify refresh token)
SPOTIFY_CLIENT=(spotify client id)
```
And then do these commands:
```
npm install
tsc
node.ts
```
